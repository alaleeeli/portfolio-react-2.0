The final layers are those for classification, starting with a softmax layer which represents the output as probabilities, then at the end is the pixel classification layer outputs the class names for each pixel value, it takes the class names to balance the process of labeling them according to their weights and avoid any imbalance since the network assume the labels are evenly distributed through the images, as in table (I), background pixels are the most frequent one and the network will consider that when assigning labels to pixels. The class weights were calculated using (2). The model overall consists of 22 layers, as shown in Figure 5.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,eAAe,SAASA,sBAAsBA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC7C,oBACIC,OAAA,CAAAC,SAAA;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACIF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACIF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,ssBAMnB;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACIF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,mkBAKvB;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAOH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAOH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAIH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAKH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACIF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;MAAW;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,wmBAKtB;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAMH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAKH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAMH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAIH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAOH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAKH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAOH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC;EAAA,eACN,CAAC;AAEX;AAACC,EAAA,GAvGuBR,sBAAsB;AAAA,IAAAQ,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
